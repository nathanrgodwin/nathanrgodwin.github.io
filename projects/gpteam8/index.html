              Concept:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              This car was designed for a competition in which cars are timed on a course with 1"-wide white tape.
              At UC San Diego, this competition is called Grand PrIEEE but at other schools the competition has different
              names, such as NATCAR at UC Davis. The competition rules state that the car must be electrically powered, have 
              four or fewer wheels, and have a home-built motor controller using discrete components and ICs.
            </p>

              Design:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              This project is currently in progress, so the design of the final product may change and photos will be added to this project description. 
              The car is designed as a electric 1/12th scale vehicle with a 1800mAH 30C Lipo battery, an indoor RC
              racing chassis with foam tires, 1D linescan camera, an ATmega328p for data collection, and a Teensy 3.5 for data processing. The motor is driven with a full H-bridge with a gate driver for
              more effective PWM control of the motors to drive them in a linear control region.
            </p>
            <h3 class="description-title"> 
              Step 1: Designing a Motor Driver:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              An H bridge is a circuit that allows a voltage to be applied either forward or backwards across a load. The initial design of our H bridge was a half H bridge which only provided an option for
              one-directional current flow, however, in order to increase brake speed, a second H bridge half was created to allow current to flow against the motor's forward current path. Robust MOSFETs were selected
              to have a large maximum drain current and low gate capacitance. A gate driver was selected based on its current output and damage prevention safety features. The initial build of the motor driver failed when
              the gate driver burned out. An examination of the gate driver chip revealed that the internal bootstrap diode had died. Rebuilding the circuit with a more sturdy external diode augmenting the internal diode
              provided a functioning motor driver circuit that seamlessly ran the motor with a PWM signal.
            </p>

              Step 2: Assembling the Chassis:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              A carbon fiber RC indoor racing chassis with a rear differential and front and back suspension was selected. The chassis was assembled and tested with the motor driver circuit.
            </p>
            <h3 class="description-title"> 
              Step 3: Seeing the Road Ahead:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              In order to follow the track, a 1-dimensional line scan was chosen. The camera returns an analog value for the brightness at each point along a horizontal line. Differentiating the line data allows us
              to determine where the edges of the track are along the line scan. This provides a means to evaluate the center point of the track relative to the front of the car. If the center of the track is left
              of the center of the car, the wheels would then turn left to compensate. A design decision was made to have an ATmega328p collect the camera data and provide only the center point to the Teensy which would
              handle control systems for driving maneuvers. Additional data would be collected by the ATmega328p with a hall sensor attached outside of the non-driven tires in the front of the car. A pair of magnets inside
              of the wheel would allow the ATmega328p to calculate the rotations per minute and consequently, the speed of the car.
