              Concept:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              The role of Quarterly Project chair was one that I pioneered for UCSD's branch of IEEE. The concept was that I
              would organize and run a project competition consisting of ten teams of three people. The projects would run for
              ten weeks using a very limited budget. Teams would be selected to prioritize applicants without prior project
              experience in order to prepare participants for the more complicated annual projects. My primary duties as Quarterly 
              Project chair were to do budgeting and reimbursement for each team, to provide technical support for both programming 
              and electronic problems, holding workshops to teach basic embedded programming and electronics skills, and handling
              administrative issues such as team member withdrawal and competition organization.

              Quarterly Project 1: Interactive Art Project:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              Each quarterly project is assigned a theme. The themes are intentionally broad in order to allow teams more
              freedom with their projects. For the first quarter, the theme was Interactive Art Project.
              Because the program was new, sign-ups were low and only nine teams of three people were formed. The teams
              each had a budget of $50, an Arduino, and a set of peripherals and sensors. Teams were required to submit
              project proposals to ensure that their designs were achievable within the scope of the project. Additionally,
              I provided guidance in the design portion of the teams' projects. The quarter culminated in
              a showcase displaying the completed projects.

              Quarterly Project 2: Games:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              The theme for the second Quarterly Project competition was games. After the success of the first Quarterly Projects, the
              applicant pool increased from 27 applicants to 60 applicants and continues to increase each quarter. Ten teams of three
              people were selected and the projects were structured in a similar manner to the first Quarterly Projects. The second
              Quarterly Projects concluded with a project competition in which each person present at the competition was given two
              tickets to distribute to the team or teams of their choosing. First, second, and third place winners were selected as
              by counting which teams had the most tickets.
