              Concept:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              Cymer is a San Diego based company that produces deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light
              sources used for semiconductor lithography. EUV is significant because it provides the means to advance
              semiconductor feature size below the 22nm node. The work that I did at Cymer was the production of an automated
              design verification system for the Timing and Energy Module for their EUV system.

              EUV and Plasma-Produced-Lasers:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              Cymer's EUV systems produce 13.5nm laser light through a method known as plasma-produced-lasers. A high
              energy laser, generated in the sub-fab is transmitted up to a vacuum chamber on the fab level. The vacuum chamber is required
              because at 13.5nm, the light is absorbed quickly in air. The laser is then focused onto
              a spot in front of a large concave focusing mirror. Tin droplets of about 30um in diameter are fired in front
              of the mirror where they are hit by the high energy laser at a rate of 50kHz. The tin is vaporized into
              laser-produced-plasma which generates photons at approximately 13.5nm. These photos are collected and reflected
              by the mirror where they are transmitted to a focus point and enter the scanner. In the scanner, the
              EUV light is projected onto a semiconductor mask where it produces the required features on a silicon wafer.

              Pre-pulse and Main-Pulse:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              In order to ensure that a maximum amount of plasma is produced by the tin droplet,
              the droplet is illuminated twice by the 30kW; these illuminations are known as pre-pulse and main-pulse. Pre-pulse
              hits the droplet at a lower energy than main-pulse and flattens the droplet into a pancake shape; this
              allows a larger surface area of the droplet to be exposed to the main laser pulse.
            </p>
            <h3 class="description-title"> 
              Timing and Energy Module:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              The Timing and Energy module (TEM) is a system within the high energy laser system which monitors signals from the high
              energy laser system generators as well as sets triggers for the pre-pulse and main-pulse triggers from a primary pulse
              trigger or to meet certain specifications. The actions of the TEM are controlled by an internal FPGA and the module
              includes a variety of interfaces.
            </p>
            <h3 class="description-title"> 
              Testing the TEM:
            </h3> 
            <p class="description-text"> 
              The engineers at Cymer wanted a Design Verification Test (DVT) to ensure that changes made to the TEM's code
              did not affect the overall functionality before the code in the clean room module was updated. This would simplify
              the debug process because it would reduce the number of times that engineers would need to suit up to resolve
              problems on clean room equipment.
              <br>
              <br>
              An existing set of test scripts was written for a previous TEM version, however significant changes to the TEM prevented
              this old script from working properly. The old testing system took approximately 8 hours to run and required continuous
              operator presence to adjust the test conditions. I wrote a new suite of Python scripts to test the inputs, outputs, and
              functionality of the TEM system. The suite utilized an RS232 serial connection to write data to registers in the FPGA in
              the TEM; this method provided a means to control the functionality and output characteristics of the TEM. The outputs of
              the TEM were routed through a four port output mux to an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope was connected to the script PC via ethernet.
              This oscilloscope connection was used to determine if the outputs of the TEM were functioning correctly. The scripts had
              a variety of modes: 'no operator' which runs only tests with no operator intervention required, 'test select' which allows
              user selection of which tests to run, 'full output' which used the actual output ports instead of the front output mux.
              Additional scripts were developed for manual and automated reading and writing of FPGA registers.
            </p>
            <h3 class="description-title"> 
              Result:
            </h3>
            <p class="description-text"> 
              The Python scripts resulted in a suite of over 8000 tests on a variety of outputs with 6 out of 9 of the test procedures requiring
              no operator intervention. Including scripts that require operator intervention, the testing process took
              1 hour, a 7 hour reduction in operator-on-bench time from the previous script.
